  💌 To You, My Calm One...
It all started so simply.
Just a screen… just a chat… just two names.
But somehow, something about you felt different.

You didn’t try to impress.
You didn’t talk too much.
But your silence?
It had a kind of peace I didn’t know I needed.

You made eye contact that didn’t just see me —
It understood me.
Even when I overthink everything…
Even when I act silly or go quiet...
You stayed.
And that meant everything.

I still remember our first meeting —
So clear, so warm.
I knew from that moment:
“You’re not just someone I met.
You’re someone I was meant to meet.”

Since then, we’ve had our own little world.
Not perfect. But ours.

You stayed on a video call while I slept.
We played hide and seek under a bedsheet.
We walked in the rain — even when you said “no” at first,
you saw me wanting it… and you came along anyway.
That moment still lives in me.

You didn’t say much, but you always made me feel safe.
You still do.

And now I’m giving you a watch —
Not just because it’s your birthday.
But because I’ve loved every second of you being with me.
Every moment we’ve shared.
Every silent comfort you gave.

I don’t always say it loudly.
But if you ever wonder…

Yes, I choose you.
Quietly. Completely. Every time.

Love,
Your Thangamae 💛🌙
