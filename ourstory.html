    <p><strong>💌 To You, My Calm One...</strong></p>

    <p>It all started so simply.<br>
    Just a screen… just a chat… just two names.<br>
    But somehow, something about you felt different.</p>

    <p>You didn’t try to impress.<br>
    You didn’t talk too much.<br>
    But your silence?<br>
    It had a kind of peace I didn’t know I needed.</p>

    <p>You made eye contact that didn’t just see me —<br>
    It understood me.<br>
    Even when I overthink everything…<br>
    Even when I act silly or go quiet...<br>
    You stayed.<br>
    And that meant everything.</p>

    <p>I still remember our first meeting —<br>
    So clear, so warm.<br>
    I knew from that moment:<br>
    “You’re not just someone I met.<br>
    You’re someone I was meant to meet.”</p>

    <p>Since then, we’ve had our own little world.<br>
    Not perfect. But ours.</p>

    <p>You stayed on a video call while I slept.<br>
    We played hide and seek under a bedsheet.<br>
    That moment still lives in me.</p>

    <p>You didn’t say much, but you always made me feel safe.<br>
    You still do.</p>

    <p>I’ve loved every second of you being with me.<br>
    Every moment we’ve shared.<br>
    Every silent comfort you gave.</p>

    <p>I don’t always say it loudly.<br>
    But if you ever wonder…</p>

    <p><strong>Yes, I choose you.<br>
    Quietly. Completely. Every time.</strong></p>

    <p>Love,<br>
    Your Thangamae 💛🌙</p>
